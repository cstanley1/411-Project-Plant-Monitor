# Software
In order to put software on our ATMEGA32U4 Microprocessor we first had to put a bootloader on the chip. By attatching the ATMEGA Chip to the serial output on our PCB we can put the bootloader on the chp and then upload the code directly through USB. Some helpful recorces for uploading the dootloader and code can be found here:
